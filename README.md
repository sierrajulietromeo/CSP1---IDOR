## 📋 Overview

**HealthTrack Medical Portal** is a simulated patient records system that allows you to learn about IDOR vulnerabilities through hands-on penetration testing. You will discover how to exploit common access control flaws in web applications.

### What is IDOR?

**Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** occurs when an application exposes direct references to internal objects (like database IDs) without properly verifying that the user is authorised to access them.

## 🚀 Running in GitHub Codespaces

### Setup Steps

1. **Open the application in GitHub Codespaces:**

2. **Codespaces will automatically install dependencies. If for some reason it doesn't, you can run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Codespaces will automatically initialise the database. If for some reason it doesn't, you can run:**
   ```bash
   npm run init
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Demo Credentials

### Accessing the Application

When you start the server in Codespaces:
- Port 3000 will be automatically forwarded
- A notification will appear with a button to open the application
- Alternatively, go to the **Ports** tab in Codespaces and click the globe icon next to port 3000
